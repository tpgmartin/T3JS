# T3JS

This is my attempt to create a tic tac toe game with JavaScript, following the steps in the 
[Odin project](http://www.theodinproject.com/javascript-and-jquery/tic-tac-toe).

The algorithm used to find winning positions comes from [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2070359/finding-three-elements-in-an-array-whose-sum-is-closest-to-an-given-number) 
stack overflow response
